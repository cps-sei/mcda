{"name":"MCDA","tagline":"Model Checking Distributed Algorithms","body":"In the Model Checking for Distributed Applications (MCDA) project, we are developing tools and demonstrations for producing verifiably correct distributed applications (i.e., software implementing distributed algorithms) with safety-critical requirements. Our current focus is on applications where nodes are mobile and communicate wirelessly. A canonical example is a team of robots sharing a physical area that must achieve a goal without collisions.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n*Approach*\r\n\r\nWe have developed a domain specific language -- called DASL -- for writing distributed applications and their safety properties assuming synchronous network communication. We have also developed a [verifying compiler] (https://asimod.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/2004/SLIDES/slides/mod04_hoare_02.pdf) for DASL programs -- called `daslc` -- that first verifies a DASL program against its safety property using Software Model Checking (we are currently using [CBMC] (http://www.cprover.org/cbmc)). If the verification succeeds, `daslc` generates C++ code for the program against the [MADARA] (http://madara.sourceforge.net/) middleware. MADARA ensures the synchronous network abstraction assumed by the application even if the underlying network is asynchronous with unbounded latency. `daslc` can also generate code that can be simulated with the [VREP] (http://www.coppeliarobotics.com) simulator. See our [tutorial] (https://code.google.com/p/mcda/wiki/Tutorial) for details.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n*Using*\r\n\r\nDownload and compile the [source code] (https://code.google.com/p/mcda/source/checkout), follow the [installation instructions] (https://code.google.com/p/mcda/source/browse/INSTALL.txt), and then follow the [tutorial] (https://code.google.com/p/mcda/wiki/Tutorial).
