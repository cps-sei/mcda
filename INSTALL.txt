INTRODUCTION
------------

  In this file, you will find instructions for building and installing
  the tools in the Model Checking for Distributed Applications (MCDA)
  project. We currently support two platforms: LINUX (tested on
  Kubuntu 13.10 64 bit) and WINDOWS (tested on Windows 7). If you have
  questions or comments, contact the core developers or create issues
  on the project site at http://mcda.googlecode.com.

WINDOWS INSTALLATION
--------------------

1. PREREQUISITES

  Follow instructions to install MADARA:
   https://code.google.com/p/madara/wiki/InstallationFromSource

  Download MCDA with Git:
    https://code.google.com/p/mcda/source/checkout  
  
2. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

  MCDA_ROOT = <the installation directory for the MCDA project>
  
  The installation directory for MCDA should have tools and examples
  directories inside of it. The following shows an example
  configuration, via right-clicking My Computer, selecting Advanced
  system settings, and then clicking Environment Variables.  We assume
  that MCDA is checked out into the main drive (likely C:)

  MCDA_ROOT=\mcda
  PATH=%MCDA_ROOT%\tools\daig\bin;%MCDA_ROOT%\tools\daig\lib

3. BUILDING MCDA

  To build MCDA, we use the tools made available through our
  prerequisites (see MADARA installation in Section 1. Specifically,
  we make use of the Makefile Project Creator (MPC) which is useful
  for generating standard GNU Makefiles and Visual Studio projects to
  allow for greater portability. This section assumes that you've
  already built MADARA and set your environment variables (Section 1
  and 2 above). After MADARA has been built, building MCDA involves
  two commands in a terminal.  Here, we assume Visual Studio 2010
  (vc10). Visual Studio 2008 would be vc9.

  cd %MCDA_ROOT%\tools\daig
  mwc.pl -type vc10 daig.mwc

  This will create a Visual Studio solution in the
  %MCDA_ROOT%\tools\daig directory.  Open this solution and
  build. Remember that "Release" mode will produce the most optimized,
  efficient binary. The resulting binary will be found in the bin
  directory.

LINUX INSTALLATION
------------------

1. PREREQUISITES

  Install necessary software:

  $ sudo apt-get install git subversion build-essential perl flex bison libboost-all-dev

  Download and unpack VREP from: 
    http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads.html

  Download MCDA with Git:
    git clone https://code.google.com/p/mcda mcda  
  
  Additional instructions are at:
    https://code.google.com/p/mcda/source/checkout  
  
2. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

  The following shows an example configuration, potentially in .bashrc
  or .profile, assuming that MCDA is checked out into the user's home
  directory, and VREP when unpacked created directory $HOME/vrep:

  $ export MCDA_ROOT=$HOME/mcda
  $ export PATH=$MCDA_ROOT/tools/daig/src/daslc:$PATH
  $ export PATH=$MCDA_ROOT/simulation/vrep:$PATH
  $ export ACE_ROOT=$MCDA_ROOT/madara/ace/ACE_wrappers
  $ export MADARA_ROOT=$MCDA_ROOT/madara/madara
  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ACE_ROOT/lib:$MADARA_ROOT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  $ export PATH=$ACE_ROOT/bin:$MADARA_ROOT/bin:$PATH
  $ export VREP_MCDA_ROOT=$HOME/vrep

3. BUILDING MCDA

  We have created a Makefile that does everything for you, including
  downloading and compiling the correct version of MADARA. Simply type:

  $ make -C $MCDA_ROOT
