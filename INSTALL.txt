0. INTRODUCTION

<<<<<<< HEAD
Step 1. Set environment variables, e.g., on bash:

$ export MCDA_ROOT=directory-where-MCDA-was-checked-out
$ export ACE_ROOT=$MCDA_ROOT/madara/ace/ACE_wrappers
$ export MADARA_ROOT=$MCDA_ROOT/madara/madara
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ACE_ROOT/lib:$MADARA_ROOT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ export PATH=$ACE_ROOT/bin:$MADARA_ROOT/bin:$PATH
=======
  In this file, you will find instructions for building and installing the
  tools in the Model Checking for Distributed Applications (MCDA) project.

1. PREREQUISITES

  Follow instructions to install MADARA:
   https://code.google.com/p/madara/wiki/InstallationFromSource
>>>>>>> 1d9b7fa0c371acb98de4d68f9095f88e7ddd7b3d

  Download MCDA with Git:
    https://code.google.com/p/mcda/source/checkout  
  

2. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

<<<<<<< HEAD
$ make -C $MCDA_ROOT

This will produce binary $MCDA_ROOT/tools/daig/src/daslc/daslc. You can
add $MCDA_ROOT/tools/daig/src/daslc to your path for convenience.
=======
  For each platform, you'll need to set the following environment variables:

  MCDA_ROOT = <the installation directory for the MCDA project>
  
  The installation directory for MCDA should have tools and examples
  directories inside of it.

  2.1 LINUX ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:

    The following shows an example configuration, potentially in .bashrc or .profile,
    assuming that mcda is checked out into the user's home directory.

    export MCDA_ROOT=$HOME/mcda
    export PATH=$MCDA_ROOT/tools/daig/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MCDA_ROOT/tools/daig/lib:$PATH

  2.2 WINDOWS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:

    The following shows an example configuration, via right-clicking My Computer,
    selecting Advanced system settings, and then clicking Environment Variables.
    We assume that MCDA is checked out into the main drive (likely C:)

    MCDA_ROOT=\mcda
    PATH=%MCDA_ROOT%\tools\daig\bin;%MCDA_ROOT%\tools\daig\lib


3. BUILDING MCDA

  To build MCDA, we use the tools made available through our prerequisites (see
  MADARA installation in Section 1. Specifically, we make use of the Makefile Project
  Creator (MPC) which is useful for generating standard GNU Makefiles and Visual
  Studio projects to allow for greater portability. This section assumes that you've
  already built MADARA and set your environment variables (Section 1 and 2 of this
  file).

  3.1 LINUX

    After MADARA has been built, building MCDA involves three commands in a terminal:

    cd $MCDA_ROOT/tools/daig
    mwc.pl -type gnuace daig.mwc
    make

    This should create an executable in $MCDA_ROOT/tools/daig/bin called daslc

  3.2 WINDOWS

    After MADARA has been built, building MCDA involves two commands in a terminal.
    Here, we assume Visual Studio 2010 (vc10). Visual Studio 2008 would be vc9.

    cd %MCDA_ROOT%\tools\daig
    mwc.pl -type vc10 daig.mwc

    This will create a Visual Studio solution in the %MCDA_ROOT%\tools\daig directory.
    Open this solution and build. Remember that "Release" mode will produce the most
    optimized, efficient binary. The resulting binary will be found in the bin directory.
