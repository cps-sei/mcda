INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the Model Checking for Distributed Algorithms code repository!

The MCDA project attempts to formally verify the correctness, safety or
other critical properties of distributed algorithm implementations, before
they are deployed. Our current approach involves sequentialization techniques
to analyze the structure of a program and its execution mechanics for each
participant in the networked application.

  The simulation directory contains code to run VREP simulations of the area
  coverage.
  
  /examples

  Contains various examples used to drive our work. This is very much
  a scratch area.
